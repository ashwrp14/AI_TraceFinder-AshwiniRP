# üß† AI TraceFinder ‚Äî Scanner Identification by Ashwini R P

This repository presents a forensic-grade pipeline for identifying the source scanner of a document image using handcrafted features and a single, robust classifier: **XGBoost**. The system includes preprocessing, feature extraction, model training and testing, explainability via Grad-CAM, and deployment via Gradio.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methods Used

- Grayscale Conversion  
- Wavelet Transform  
- FFT (Fast Fourier Transform)  
- PRNU (Photo-Response Non-Uniformity) Extraction  
- Feature Engineering for classification  
- XGBoost-based training and testing  
- Grad-CAM for explainability  

---

## üìå End-to-End Workflow

1. **Data Collection & Labeling**  
   - Scanned samples from 3‚Äì5 scanner brands  
   - Labeled using device metadata  

2. **Image Preprocessing**  
   - Resized, denoised, and normalized images  
   - Removed non-artifact content  

3. **Feature Extraction**  
   - Wavelet + FFT-based noise patterns  
   - PRNU signatures, LBP textures, edge maps  

4. **Model Training (XGBoost)**  
   - Trained XGBoost classifier on extracted features  
   - Applied k-fold validation (typically k=5)  
   - Augmentation: brightness, rotation  

5. **Explainability**  
   - Grad-CAM overlays for scanner-specific regions  
   - Feature importance interpretation  

6. **Output System**  
   - Upload scanned image ‚Üí predict scanner model  
   - Display confidence score + Grad-CAM overlay
